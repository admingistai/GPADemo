            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Los Angeles remained under strict lockdown for the fifth consecutive night as National Guard units, reinforced by 700 active-duty Marines, enforced a citywide curfew in response to escalating protests over recent immigration enforcement raids. The measures come amid growing national unrest and local tensions over federal immigration policy, which reached a boiling point earlier this month following several high-profile arrests of undocumented workers across Southern California.</p>

                <p>The decision to deploy military personnel was announced late Friday by California Governor Eleni Flores, who cited "extraordinary threats to public safety and infrastructure" after demonstrators clashed with law enforcement in downtown Los Angeles and torching of several autonomous vehicles. The unrest began peacefully but escalated after videos circulated online showing ICE agents conducting what appeared to be unannounced, late-night raids in predominantly Latino neighborhoods including Boyle Heights, Westlake, and Pacoima.</p>

                <p>"This is not just about immigration," said Javier Ortiz, a 28-year-old community organizer with the group Somos Barrio, speaking at a rally near MacArthur Park. "This is about dignity, about surveillance, and about militarization of our communities. People are exhausted, and now they're being criminalized for showing up." Protesters have marched nightly since Tuesday, blocking major freeways, including the 101 and 110, while some groups erected makeshift barricades and set off fireworks in front of ICE field offices.</p>

                <p>City officials reported more than 500 arrests over the last four nights, mostly for violating curfew orders and obstruction of traffic. Law enforcement confirmed that officers have deployed rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades in several neighborhoods, though no fatalities have been reported. At least 37 people have been treated for minor injuries at area hospitals, including several bystanders hit by crowd-control munitions.</p>

                <p>Mayor Karen Bass, under pressure from both activist groups and federal authorities, urged calm during a televised statement on Saturday evening, saying that while the right to protest must be protected, "no one has the right to destroy property, endanger lives, or obstruct emergency services." At the same time, she acknowledged concerns about the ICE tactics, stating that the city had not been notified in advance of the raids and would be conducting an independent review into how and where they were executed.</p>

                <p>The presence of Marines on the streets of a major American city has reignited debate over the use of military force in domestic affairs. Although technically deployed under the authority of Title 32 — which allows for federal support without fully activating the Posse Comitatus Act — civil liberties advocates expressed alarm over the optics and precedent. "This is the most visible domestic deployment since Minneapolis in 2020," said Dr. Raymond Ellis, a constitutional law scholar at Stanford University. "Even if lawful, the question is whether it's proportionate — and whether it will escalate rather than deescalate tensions."</p>

                <p>In neighborhoods affected by the protests, the mood has shifted from anger to fatigue. Several small businesses along Broadway and Olympic have closed early or boarded up entirely, fearing looting or police overreach. Ride-share companies have suspended service downtown, and Waymo, which operates autonomous cars in the city, confirmed that five of its vehicles were burned or severely damaged by demonstrators in the past 48 hours.</p>

                <p>Federal officials have remained largely silent on the raids themselves, with Homeland Security issuing only a brief statement defending the operation as "routine enforcement consistent with existing law." Privately, however, several senior administration officials acknowledged that the scale and visibility of the raids — including video footage showing agents entering homes without clear warrants — may have been a miscalculation. "There was clearly a breakdown in communication between agencies and city leadership," said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

                <p>Community leaders are calling for a moratorium on further raids, as well as an immediate demobilization of military assets. "This isn't war," said Assemblywoman Teresa Cardenas, who represents East L.A. "This is a city full of families trying to live their lives — and now they're living under occupation."</p>

                <p>As of Sunday morning, the curfew remains in effect from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., and National Guard vehicles continue to patrol areas near the Civic Center, Pershing Square, and South Figueroa. Whether calm will return in the coming days depends as much on Washington's next moves as on the city's own efforts to rebuild trust with a shaken public.</p>
